# Observation Rules

This document defines how observations are recorded in this repository.

## Scope
Observations document *what remains stable* and *what degrades* under repeated reasoning execution.

## Constraints
- Observations do not explain causes.
- Observations do not claim general model behavior.
- Observations reference concrete cases only.

## Structure
Each observation must include:
- an observable phenomenon,
- a stability status,
- a direct link to the case where it was observed.

## Non-goals
- No interpretation of internal model mechanisms.
- No performance or accuracy claims.
